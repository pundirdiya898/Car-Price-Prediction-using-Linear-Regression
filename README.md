# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on building a predictive model that estimates the selling price of used cars based on historical data and car features. Using Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, the model identifies relationships between various features (like year, mileage, brand, fuel type, etc.) and the final car price.
