🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
🧠 Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model that estimates the selling price of used cars based on historical data and car features. Using Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, the model identifies relationships between various features (like year, mileage, brand, fuel type, etc.) and the final car price.

The goal is to develop a reliable, data-driven solution to assist buyers, sellers, dealerships, and automotive platforms in making fair pricing decisions.

🎯 Objectives
Load and analyze a dataset of used car listings

Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, etc.)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns

Train a Linear Regression model to predict prices

Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² Score

Make predictions on new or unseen car data

🚀 Features
End-to-end machine learning workflow

Clean and modular codebase for easy maintenance

Visualizations to explain feature correlations and model performance

Reusable pipeline for data preprocessing and predictions

(Optional) Build a prediction UI using Streamlit or Flask

🔧 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation
